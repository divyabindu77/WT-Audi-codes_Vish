Note: 
=====
To write the query, use printjson() method from 'mongosh' module
e.g., To display all the documents from 'employees' collection 
from 'test' database.
    
    => printjson( db.getSiblingDB('test').students.find() )
    Where,
    db => databse connection object
    getSiblingDB('test') => "test" is database name
    students => collections name
    find => method to retrieve all the matched docuemnts

*/
printjson(db.getSiblingDB('test').students.find({
    $or:[
        {department:"Mathematics"},
        {gpa:{$lt:3.3}}
        ] 
},
{_id:0,name:1,department:1,gpa:1}));
